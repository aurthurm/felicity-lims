Here's the flow from folder creation to document lifecycle in your system:

1. **Folder Creation**
   - Create `DocumentFolder` records (can be nested with parent-child relationships)
   - Folders provide organizational structure for documents

2. **Template Setup**
   - Create `DocumentTemplate` records with reusable content structures
   - Link templates to `DocumentCategory` for organization

3. **Document Creation**
   - Create `Document` record linked to a folder and optional template
   - Assign authors through `document_author` junction table
   - Set initial permissions via `document_reader` junction table
   - Add tags using `document_tagged` junction table

4. **Version Management**
   - Create initial `DocumentVersion` with content and version number
   - Document.content property surfaces the latest version's content
   - New versions are added as the document evolves

5. **Document Status Workflow**
   - Add `DocumentStatus` record with initial state (DRAFT)
   - Document.status property surfaces the latest status
   - Status changes are tracked in status history

6. **Review Process**
   - Create `DocumentReviewCycle` to initiate reviews
   - Add `DocumentReviewStep` records for each reviewer in sequence
   - Update document status based on review outcome

7. **Publication & Access**
   - Change document status to PUBLISHED or EFFECTED when approved
   - `DocumentAudit` records track all user interactions
   - Related documents linked via `document_relation` table

8. **Subscriptions & Notifications**
   - Users subscribe via `DocumentSubscription` records
   - System notifies subscribers of relevant changes

This flow ensures document integrity, tracks all changes, maintains proper versioning, and enables workflow management through the document lifecycle.





#AI
Integration Flow:

Authoring: AI suggests content when drafting documents, tracking conversation history
Compliance: Upload standards as ComplianceStandard records, run AIComplianceCheck against documents
Review: During DocumentReviewStep, generate AIReviewFeedback with suggestions
Analytics: After document updates, run analysis to provide insights on document quality

This architecture allows your system to:

Assist with document creation using AI
Automatically check compliance against SOPs and standards
Provide AI-generated review suggestions to human reviewers
Analyze document quality and extract insights

You can start with basic implementations and gradually add more advanced AI capabilities over time.
