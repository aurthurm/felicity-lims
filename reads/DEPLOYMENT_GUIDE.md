## Production Implementation for Existing Clients

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Target Audience:** DevOps, Database Administrators, Technical Leads  
**Estimated Timeline:** 4-8 weeks per client

---

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying HIPAA-compliant encryption to existing Felicity LIMS clients
with non-encrypted data. The process uses a zero-downtime migration strategy with comprehensive validation and rollback
procedures.

---

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] **Database Access**: Full administrative access to client database
- [ ] **Backup Capability**: Ability to create and restore full database backups
- [ ] **Maintenance Window**: Scheduled 2-4 hour maintenance window
- [ ] **Storage Space**: 150-200% of current database size during migration
- [ ] **Python Environment**: Python 3.8+ with required dependencies

### Pre-Migration Validation

- [ ] **System Health Check**: Verify current system stability
- [ ] **Data Integrity Validation**: Run data consistency checks
- [ ] **Performance Baseline**: Establish current performance metrics
- [ ] **Backup Verification**: Test backup and restore procedures
- [ ] **Client Communication**: Confirm maintenance window with client

---

## Phase 1: Environment Preparation (Week 1)

### 1.1 Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p /backups/hipaa_migration/$(date +%Y%m%d)
cd /backups/hipaa_migration/$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Verify disk space (need 2x database size)
df -h /backups
df -h /var/lib/postgresql
```

### 1.2 Database Backup

```bash
# Create comprehensive backup
sudo -u postgres pg_dump \
  --verbose \
  --format=custom \
  --compress=9 \
  --file=felicity_pre_hipaa_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup \
  felicity_production

# Verify backup integrity
sudo -u postgres pg_restore \
  --list \
  felicity_pre_hipaa_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup
```

### 1.3 Environment Configuration

```bash
# Add encryption keys to environment
export HIPAA_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-encryption-key-here"
export SEARCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-search-key-here"

# Add to .env file for persistence
echo "HIPAA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=${HIPAA_ENCRYPTION_KEY}" >> /opt/felicity/.env
echo "SEARCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY=${SEARCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY}" >> /opt/felicity/.env
echo "USE_ENCRYPTED_SEARCH=false" >> /opt/felicity/.env
echo "HIPAA_MIGRATION_COMPLETE=false" >> /opt/felicity/.env
```

### 1.4 Code Deployment

```bash
# Deploy HIPAA branch code
cd /opt/felicity
git fetch origin data-at-rest
git checkout data-at-rest

# Install new dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test application startup
python -c "from felicity.apps.patient.entities import Patient; print('Import test passed')"
```

---

## Phase 2: Schema Migration (Week 2)

### 2.1 Apply Database Schema Changes

```bash
# Run schema extension migration
cd /opt/felicity
python -m alembic upgrade head

# Verify new tables created
psql felicity_production -c "
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('patient_search_index', 'phone_search_index', 'date_search_index');
"

# Verify new columns added
psql felicity_production -c "
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'patient' AND column_name LIKE '%_encrypted';
"
```

### 2.2 Validate Schema Changes

```bash
# Run schema validation
python hippaa/validate_schema.py

# Check migration status
psql felicity_production -c "
SELECT 
  'patient' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(migration_status) as with_status
FROM patient
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'analysis_result' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(migration_status) as with_status
FROM analysis_result;
"
```

---

## Phase 3: Data Migration (Weeks 3-4)

### 3.1 Pre-Migration Testing

```bash
# Test migration on small subset (dry run)
cd /opt/felicity
python hippaa/run_migration.py --dry-run --batch-size 10

# Test encryption/decryption
python -c "
from felicity.utils.encryption import encrypt_pii, decrypt_pii
test_data = 'John Doe'
encrypted = encrypt_pii(test_data)
decrypted = decrypt_pii(encrypted)
assert decrypted == test_data
print('Encryption test passed')
"
```

### 3.2 Production Data Migration

```bash
# Start migration with logging
cd /opt/felicity
nohup python hippaa/run_migration.py \
  --batch-size 100 \
  > migration_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress
tail -f migration_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# Check migration status
python hippaa/run_migration.py --validate-only
```

### 3.3 Migration Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor database performance
psql felicity_production -c "
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  n_tup_ins as inserts,
  n_tup_upd as updates,
  n_tup_del as deletes
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('patient', 'analysis_result', 'patient_search_index')
ORDER BY tablename;
"

# Monitor disk usage
df -h /var/lib/postgresql

# Monitor system resources
htop
```

### 3.4 Incremental Validation

```bash
# Validate batches during migration
while true; do
  psql felicity_production -c "
    SELECT 
      migration_status,
      COUNT(*) 
    FROM patient 
    GROUP BY migration_status;
  "
  sleep 300  # Check every 5 minutes
done
```

---

## Phase 4: Application Cutover (Week 5)

### 4.1 Enable Encrypted Search

```bash
# Update feature flags
sed -i 's/USE_ENCRYPTED_SEARCH=false/USE_ENCRYPTED_SEARCH=true/' /opt/felicity/.env

# Restart application services
systemctl restart felicity-web
systemctl restart felicity-worker
systemctl restart felicity-scheduler
```

### 4.2 Application Testing

```bash
# Test patient search functionality
python -c "
import asyncio
from felicity.apps.patient.services import PatientService

async def test_search():
    service = PatientService()
    results = await service.high_performance_search(first_name='John')
    print(f'Search test returned {len(results)} results')

asyncio.run(test_search())
"

# Test analysis result search
python -c "
import asyncio
from felicity.apps.analysis.services.result import AnalysisResultService

async def test_result_search():
    service = AnalysisResultService()
    results = await service.hipaa_compliant_search_by_result('Positive')
    print(f'Result search returned {len(results)} results')

asyncio.run(test_result_search())
"
```

### 4.3 Performance Validation

```bash
# Benchmark search performance
python hippaa/benchmark_search.py \
  --iterations 100 \
  --search-terms "John,Smith,test@example.com"

# Compare with baseline metrics
python hippaa/compare_performance.py \
  --baseline baseline_metrics.json \
  --current current_metrics.json
```

```

### 5.2 Client User Acceptance Testing

```bash
# Create test accounts for client validation
python hippaa/create_test_data.py \
  --client-id CLIENT_001 \
  --test-patients 10 \
  --test-results 50

# Provide client with test credentials and validation checklist

# If data corruption detected, restore from backup
sudo -u postgres dropdb felicity_production
sudo -u postgres createdb felicity_production
sudo -u postgres pg_restore \
  --dbname=felicity_production \
  felicity_pre_hipaa_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup
```

### Planned Rollback (After Issues Found)

```bash
# Disable encrypted search
sed -i 's/USE_ENCRYPTED_SEARCH=true/USE_ENCRYPTED_SEARCH=false/' /opt/felicity/.env

# Restart with compatibility mode
systemctl restart felicity-web

# Investigate issues before proceeding
tail -f /var/log/felicity/application.log
```

SELECT 
  ROUND(
    (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE migration_status = 'failed') * 100.0) / 
    NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 
    2
  )
FROM patient;
")

if (( $(echo "$FAILURE_RATE > 5" | bc -l) )); then

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Migration Stuck or Very Slow

```bash
# Check database locks
psql felicity_production -c "
SELECT 
  pid,
  usename,
  application_name,
  state,
  query_start,
  query
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state != 'idle';
"

# Check system resources
iostat -x 1 5
free -m
```

#### Issue: Encryption/Decryption Errors

```bash
# Verify encryption keys
python -c "
from felicity.utils.encryption import encrypt_pii, decrypt_pii
import os
print('HIPAA_ENCRYPTION_KEY configured:', bool(os.environ.get('HIPAA_ENCRYPTION_KEY')))
test = encrypt_pii('test')
print('Encryption test:', test[:20] + '...')
print('Decryption test:', decrypt_pii(test))
"

# Check key consistency
grep HIPAA_ENCRYPTION_KEY /opt/felicity/.env
```

#### Issue: Search Results Inconsistent

```bash
# Rebuild search indices
python hippaa/rebuild_search_indices.py

# Validate search index consistency
python hippaa/validate_search_indices.py

# Compare encrypted vs plaintext search results
python hippaa/compare_search_results.py
```
